                      <div class="grid-item" id="soc">
                        <p>Social change, economic change, political change, structural change - the world is on the move. Today already feels like the day before yesterday.</p>
                      </div>

                        <p>Relationship is the magic word of the 21st century. Relationship creates value. This applies to partnership. And to work.</p>
                      </div> 
                      <div class="grid-item" id="rig">
                        <p>Rigid structures dissolve. The shriveled branches are swept from the trees. Only what bends will not break.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="grid-item" id="tak">
                        <p>Take the risk to show yourself. But remember: If you show your innermost, express your desires and present your talents, you need a protective space to feel safe.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="grid-item" id="mor">
                        <p>The more distributed the power of decision, the less the impetus to gain a position of superiority for oneself.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="grid-item" id="age">
                        <p>The age of information is a time of empowerment. The empowerment of the self is what philosophers have been dreaming of for centuries.</p>
                      </div>

                        <p>Core decision makers are overwhelmed by today's complexity. The intelligent swarm is increasingly needed in decision-making.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="grid-item" id="inla">
                        <p>In large organizations, management is decoupled from its employees. Middle management tries to close this gap - and is overburdened by the rapid changes in production conditions.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="grid-item" id="holi">
                        <p>Holistic governance acts as servant leadership, relies on the competence of employees and strengthens their decision-making power. This is effective, efficient and sustainable.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="grid-item" id="tod">
                        <p>Today's society needs quick answers, quick solutions. The hierarchical decision-making dinosaurs of the past are overwhelmed by the complex challenges of the present.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="grid-item" id="larg">
                        <p>Large organizations are collapsing these days because they can't handle the gradual transition to horizontal decision making. They would have to reinvent themselves.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="grid-item" id="if">
                        <p>If you love your work, your work will turn into a lovable product. Buyers and users will love it. The world needs less and less unlovable and therefore unloved products.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="grid-item" id="self">
                        <p>Self-empowerment and the sharing of responsibility characterize the progress of the present. Self-empowerment and strategies for withdrawing as well as shunning responsibility are increasingly outdated.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="grid-item" id="infor">
                        <p>Shared responsibility relies on communication. Meaningful exchange is the fuel of change. However, if too many channels are used simultaneously, a fog of meaning is created. Agile methods such as Scrum help to clear the fog.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="grid-item" id="holom">
                        <p>Holosophy means a kind of cybernetic cooperation. There are strong and weak interactions. Weak are disinterest, lack of motivation and hierarchy conflicts. Strong is combined enthusiasm.</p>
